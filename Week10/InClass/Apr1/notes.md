## JavaScript 

.innerHTML – change the text between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element of our choosing.

>- document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "I just changed the content of this div using JavaScript";

alert(); – displays a pop up window with the data we pass in to the ()

>- alert(“Hello World!”);

console.log(); – logs data to the javascript console (we can access this with Google Developer Tools or Firebug)

>- console.log(“this is my first console log!”);

------
>- Variables (we can create programming instructions or statements) are composed of values, operators, expressions, key words, and comments 
>- Semicolons tell the java script that you're done witht he line, like a period
>- Code Block, inside curly brackets is used to define statements to be executed together

# JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

```js
// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```

### JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values
- Variable values

Fixed values are called **Literals**.

Variable values are called **Variables**.

### Literals

```js
// Numbers can be written with or without decimals
10.1;
2025;
```

Strings are plain text, written within double (or single) quotes:

> "HI HI";

> 'Hey Hey';

### JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare variables.

An equal sign `=` is used to assign values to variables.

```js
let x;
x = 5;
```

### JavaScript Operators & Expressions

Arithmetic operators ( `+` `-` `\` `*` `/` ) are used to compute values.

Assignment operator ( `=` ) are used to assign values to variables.

```js
(5 + 5) * 2;

let a, b;
a = 1;
b = 3;
```

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
The computation is called an evaluation.

> `5 * 10` OR `x * 10`

You can also write expressions for strings:

```js
"Sally" + " " + "Mae";
```

This would make
`Sally Mae`

### JavaScript Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

    A JavaScript name must begin with:

    A letter (A-Z or a-z)

    A dollar sign (`$`)

    Or an underscore (`_`)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

> ### JavaScript is Case Sensitive!

### How to write JS:

**Underscore**:

    first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

**Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):**

    FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

**Lower Camel Case:**

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

    firstName, lastName, masterCard, hotPocket
