            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup all purpose flower</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup cocoa</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>3 large brown bananas</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup canola vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips</li> 
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat your oven to 350°F. Grease a pan with non stick cooking spray and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork. Add the melted butter and oil and stir until combined. Stir in the brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, don't overmix. Stir in 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips.</li>
                    <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup of chocolate chips over the top of the bread. Bake for 50-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out mostly clean, you might have some melted chocolate chips on the toothpick and that is fine. You just don't want a lot of gooey batter. Check at 50 minutes, just to be safe. Oven times vary.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire cooking rack. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the bread and carefully remove from the pan. Let the bread cool on the wire cooling rack until slightly warm. Cut into slices and serve.</li>
